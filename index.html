            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The eighth edition of the well-known Congress of Feminist Economics will be held in Barcelona from 16 to
                18 March 2023. This is a key event for strengthening ties between academia and the city's feminist
                socio-economic scene.</p>


            <p class="feminist-economics-quote">Feminist economics is the critical study of economics and economies,
                with a focus on gender-aware and inclusive economic inquiry and policy analysis.</p>

                    opportunities created by the digital revolution, and more specifically on the collaborative economy
                    and the commons) organized three seminars that took place this spring at Barcelona's Canòdrom-Ateneu
                    d'Innovació Digital i Democràtica. They aimed to enrich the congress's content and networking
                    processes.</p>

                <h2>Feminist economics perspectives and practices in Barcelona</h2>
                <p><a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaia_P%C3%A9rez_Orozco" target="_blank">Amaia Pérez
                        Orozco</a> gave an introduction reviewing the previous editions and emphasizing that these had
                    acted as a meeting point for universities and the world of the active economy. She stressed the need
                    for an assembly to make a feminist economy possible and break down barriers between academia,
                    activism and the major industries.</p>

                <blockquote class="seminar">
                    <p><span class="quote">“</span>"All policies should reverse gender inequality.”</p>
                    <p class="author">Amaia Pérez Orozco</p>
                </blockquote>


                <p>She believes that retaining the hybrid format is essential in order to include Latin America, build
                    bridges between universities worldwide and establish a collective responsibility. As universities
                    are becoming neoliberal, these kinds of events are increasingly important.</p>
                <p>She emphasized four key improvements that this congress can bring for a better future:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Bringing a feminist perspective to digital issues</li>
                    <li>Building this meeting space beyond borders</li>
                    <li>Using the public to move toward the public-community</li>
                    <li>Moving beyond markets without losing sight of them, as they are the centre of the system</li>
                </ol>

            <section class="care-economy">
                <p>After two years of living in a pandemic and in a context of digital acceleration, social inequalities
                    are increasing and are also apparent in the digital world, from a more macro perspective to a more
                    micro one. Inequalities are flourishing in the market, in economic and political institutions, in
                    the family and the social fabric, and in sexual-affective relationships. “So, the economy of care
                    work is one of the most vulnerable areas, and reforming it and making it feminist and emancipatory
                    is crucial. It is not just a matter of changing the percentages of men and women, but of having a
                    civilizing alternative, and reforming heteropatriarchal capitalism”, said Sandra Ezquerra.</p>
