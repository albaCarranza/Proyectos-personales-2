        <h2>Seminar: Gender in Technology and Digital Economy</h2>
        <p>The second seminar was held on 27 April, and involved Eva Cruells (Donestech) and Nuria Alonso (Colectic). To
          introduce the discussion, Mayo Fuster pointed out the importance of considering the digital perspective in the
          debate over the future of the feminist economy, as the intersection between economics, feminism, and
          digitalization has been addressed to a very limited extent to date.</p>
        <p>Digitalization has accelerated exponentially, and so has gender violence in the digital world. Following a
          systematic review of the literature, Mayo noted that there has been no feminist theory analysis, and
          specifically of the feminist economy in the digital realm.</p>
        <p>After Fuster's contribution, Eva Cruells joined the debate. She is a member of Donestech, a research group
          that aims to clarify specific issues in order to transform research into a reserve of useful knowledge for
          people concerned about gender inequalities, and for people focusing on social and political transformation.
          This project analyses existing data, information and research at an international level and addresses real and
          everyday practices.</p>
